array with associated cost of the bubble solutions from the array defined earlier is an example for 'parallel array' <br><br>
pseudocode for getting the cost effective solution<br>
FUNCTION GETCOSTEFFECTIVESOLUTION (SCORE, COSTS, HIGHSCORE) <br>
DECLARE a variable cost and set to 100 <br>
DECLARE a variable index <br>
FOR let i = 0; i < scores.length ; i++ <br>
....IF the bubble solution at score[i] has the highest score <br>
........IF the current value of cost is greater than the cost of bubble solution <br>
........THEN <br>
............SET the value of cost to the cost of bubble solution <br>
............SET the value of cost to the cost of the bubble solution <br>
........END IF <br>
....END IF <br>
END FOR <br>
RETURN index <br>
